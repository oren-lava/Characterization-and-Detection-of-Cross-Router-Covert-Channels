# Characterization and Detection of Cross-Router Covert Channels

This repository contains the source code used in the paper "Characterization and Detection of Cross-Router Covert Channels". The full data used in the paper is accessible with [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h1lWvswOnmDA2hYyrrAQ5CUjDiv0dTMG?usp=sharing).

## Attacks

The paper presentes two network timing covert channel that break logical isolation between two networks hosted by a single shared router: CRCC and Wi-Fi Micro-jamming attacks. 

By using these covert channels, we were able to leak information between the two networks, even though the overt communication is blocked.

Both attacks deliberately exhausta the router's physical resources according to the leaked information bits. By doing so, a machine in the host network can signal the information to a machine in the guest network that periodically measures the router's response times. Normal response times are associated with the '0' bit, and large response times are associated with the '1' bit.

## Defense

The paper also presents a method of detecting both attacks using a ML/DL detector. The models extract behavioral features from the network traffic and can detect anomalies caused by these attacks. The models used are semi-supervised models that perform novelty detection.

To detect the attacks we used:

* CRCC detection: Deep Autoencoder.
* Wi-Fi Micro-jamming detection: Local Outlier Factor (LOF).

## Getting Started

### Repository contents

The Attacks folder contains the source code for both attacks along with documents and pictures to help assembling their setup.

The Defense folder contains the source code of the ML/DL detector, the feature extractor, and the actual features used in the paper.

### Dependencies

* Python 3
* Scapy
* tcpdump
* Wireshark + tshark

### Setup

* The setup should be built as described in the paper.
* You can also refer to the manuals in the "Attacks" folder.
